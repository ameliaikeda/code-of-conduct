<h1 align="center">Monzo Community Code of Conduct</h1>

> <sub>last updated: _15th Jan 2018_</sub>
>
> <sub>*This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future.*</sub>

This code of conduct covers the [Monzo Community Forum][monzo-community], the [Monzo Developers Slack][monzo-slack], and any other interactions between users on Monzo's platforms.

All of Monzo's platforms should be a safe place for everybody regardless of _gender, gender identity or gender expression_, _sexual orientation_, _disability_, _physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)_, _race_, _age_, or _religion_.

We have a zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination and _at minimum_ users will be suspended from our communities for violations.

### Agreements

As someone who is part of this community, **you agree** that:

* we are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* we have **zero tolerance** for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* we respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* we refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* we avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

We actively work towards:

* being a safe community.
* cultivating a network of support and encouragement for each other.
* encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

We condemn:

* stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information.
* threats of harm or harassment.
* anything that compromises people’s safety.

## Disputes

You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:

* name-calling.
* ad hominem attacks.
* responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
* knee-jerk contradiction.
* instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness.

* Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
* Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
* Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
* Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, **ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times**.

This is a public forum, and search engines can index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

## Be Humble

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* listen without interruption.
* believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* ask for tips and help toward avoiding reoffending in the future.
* apologise and ask forgiveness.

Do not expect someone you have wronged to forgive and forget, and don't repeatedly try to contact a user who has taken issue if they're not okay with it.

## Harassment

Targetting specific users and harassing them is unwelcome in this community. This _specifically_ includes responding to requests to stop with mockery, "Rules Lawyering" (implying harassing behavior is not harassing because it isn't explicitly stated in this document), or encouraging other users to join in. This will earn at minimum a ban, and potentially restricted access to community features.

## Reporting Misconduct

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a moderator know. Their details are below:**

* Tristan Thomas - tristan@monzo.com
* Naji Esiri — naji@monzo.com
* Richard Raybould — richard.raybould@monzo.com

Alternatively, you can private message them on the Community Forum or Slack.

## Penalities for Misconduct

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the Slack or the Community Forum. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

If a moderator finds that someone has breached the code of conduct repeatedly or excessively, they will take action up to and including serving a user notice to close their monzo account, or contacting law enforcement.
